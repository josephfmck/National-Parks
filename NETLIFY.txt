35. Prepare & Deploy To Netlify

  Not using env.local in production 

  SO
  In <GithubState/> init clientId and secret vars 
  Check if in production
    if not then set client and secret to personal API data 
    if it is then set to global client and secret 

    Personal: REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
    Global: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID

    Replace client and secret ref to the checked vars 

  NOW in "production" other people using app will use global ID and Secret 
  While I still use personal ID and Secret 

  //* NOTE: keys ARE STILL EXPOSED. Not big deal for github API since just get new keys 
  BUT NOT GOOD FOR FUTURE PROJECTS



  NOW READY FOR DEPLOYMENT TO Netlify 



  Create Free account on Netlify 

  IN TERM: Install Netlify CLI 
  npm i -g netlify-cli


  IN FILES: Create Netlify config file in root folder
  
  netlify.toml 

  In netlify.toml 

    //specify as build folder 
    //publish="name of build folder"
    [build]
      publish="build"

  NOW with react when running 
    npm run build 
  it will create a folder called "build"
  
  THIS IS Deployed Production Build

NOT Deployed yet, just initialized 
App is now Initialized on our netlify account 


ON NETLIFY SITE:    Add global environment vars 

  under deploy tab
    -deploy settings tab 
      -environment tab 
        Edit Environment vars 

  add variables: 
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = 6fa677d272683011c72b
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = df630d3e337d9a024257bc8bededee4e50f394ba

  NOW Environment Vars are stored on Server, more secure 
  FUTURE: want a diff keys for development and production 


Create build folder 
TERM:
  npm run build 

NOW have build folder in root 
build is what we want to Deploy 


DEPLOY PRODUCTION Build
